        <p>There's nothing worse than losing your family's financial security in the autumn of life because of long term care costs. You just helplessly watch as your life savings and your retirement accounts are drained month after month as your costs of care go up and up. You realize that you will soon have nothing to fall back on, no security. You think about how you will not be able to leave anything for your kids.</p>
        <p>You start thinking, <span class="font-bold">“But legal planning is expensive, and I don't like attorneys.”</span></p>
        <p>Of course, you could always come up with your own plan to navigate the complicated and punitive Medicaid regulations...</p>
        <p>... if you've got lots of legal knowledge or plenty of time to read several books on Medicaid, VA Planning and Elder Planning.</p>

                        <p>My grandparents worked hard all their lives and never spent much money. I saw how easily everything could be lost. Even as an attorney, I was unsure how to help them preserve their money in their twilight years. Since my grandparents passed, I set about learning the mysteries of elder law and specifically the Medicaid laws and regulations.</p>
                        <p>I have read books, articles and attended many days of training and seminars, and have handled many cases to become one of the few attorneys who practice Elder Law /Medicaid /VA Pension Planning. It is a highly regulated and complex area of the law, with many potential pitfalls.</p>

                <p>Keep from losing all of your assets while receiving assisted living or nursing care?</p>
                <p>Be guided through the asset protection and Medicaid application process by caring professionals?</p>
                <p>Have a friend in the legal community that your family can rely on?</p>

                <p class="italic font-semibold">The Krause Medicaid Process gives you all that and more.</p>
                <p>If you had to pay out of pocket for your care, you could expect to spend <span class="font-semibold italic">$600,000</span> or more. I'm making The Krause Medicaid Process available for a fraction of that. <span class="font-semibold italic">It costs just about what you would pay for two months of nursing care.</span></p>
                <p><span class="font-bold">But that's not all.</span> Act today, and I'll also include:</p>
